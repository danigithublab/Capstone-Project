    "For this project I have hypothesized a customer who intends to open a luxury restaurant in a wealthy borough of London.

I will then assess the top 5 wealthiest and populated boroughs of London by looking at average properties value. Then, I will identify which are the ones have more restaurants and what are the top trending venues. This will indicate which borough is the most suitable to open a luxury restaurant where people tend to go out for eating and which ones are the ones with more competition. \n",

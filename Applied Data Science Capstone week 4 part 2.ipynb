    "#Firstly, I need to look at what data are available online describing the boroughs of London. The Wikipedia page (\"List of London boroughs\", publicly available at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_London_boroughs) contains a table describing the 32 boroughs of London with their relative data about Local authority, Political control, Headquarters, Area (sq mt), Population (est 2013), geographical co-ordinates, and the number of the legend on the Wikipedia map. \n",
    "#I will use this table to determine the most populated boroughs by calculating the ratio between the Area (sq mt) and Population (est 2019). \n",
    "\n",
    "#Properties value data\n",
    "\n",
    "#In order to understand which is the average value of properties in the boroughs, I will use the table \"London property value\" publicly accessible from the government website (https://data.london.gov.uk/download/average-house-prices/b1b0079e-698c-4c0b-b8c7- aa6189590ca4/land-registry-house-prices-borough.csv). \n",
    "#The table contains information about area codes, name of the borough, the year, the measure (Mean, median, sales) and the Value. I will be focusing on mean Values from the year ending in December 2017. \n",
    "\n",
    "#Geographical and Venues Data \n",
    "\n",
    "#To get the geographical information of the borough I will use geolocator.geocode. I will then use foursquare to look at which boroughs have the highest number of restaurants and what are the top 5 trending venues. This will indicate the best borough where to open a luxury restaurant based on population, wealth, and trending venues. \n"
